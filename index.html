               <p>My first gaming experience was playing Street Fighter II with my dad and little brother. I grew to love fighting games fairly quickly. As a kid there was nothing more satisfying than winning a match or figuring out how to make Ryu throw out a fireball and spam that from across the screen. As I grew older I began to learn about the strategy involved in this kind of game. Any good fighter encourages something known as yomi, or “reading the mind of your opponent”. It means knowing what your options are any time you make a move and how your opponent could possibly react and what you can do to counter those reactions. At professional levels builds into a game of strategy where a false step will cost you everything. </p>

				<p>The RPG genre found its birth in basements and on tabletops and eventually leveled up to the digital world. RPGs, role playing games, are more character and story driven than almost any other genre of game. The best RPGs feature fleshed out worlds for the player to explore and characters for them to get to know and come to love. One reason I love RPGs is for the level of customization involved in them. Often time these games allow the player to min-max their stats and weapons. This is when you find the combination of abilities and equipment that will give your playstyle the maximum value of versatility, damage, or whatever else you man need while minimizing every area you wish to ignore. An RPG allows you to become engrossed in the tales of great heroes that you make uniquely yours. </p>

                <h2>Action Games</h2>

				</div>
				<p>Action games are a sort of middle ground between what I love in RPGs and what I love in Fighters. They have character driven storylines that let you customize and min max your abilities as you desire along with intricate combat systems that make it feel like you’re playing a fighting game at times. Often the best Action games, also known as character action games, feature storylines where events follow serial escalation. It’s not odd to start a game in this genre out beating up punks on a sidewalk and end up having epic showdowns standing in front of the literal gates of hell. </p>
