            <p>In February of 1997 Star Wars: A New Hope recieved its first remaster and a theatrical rerelease. At this point in the film's life it was a legendary movie, one that was considered iconic and even legendary in the film industry. Often called one of the most influental pieces of science fiction of its era. Of course I was unaware of all this. At the time I was a lad of only six years of age and all I knew of Star Wars was cool laser swords.</p>
